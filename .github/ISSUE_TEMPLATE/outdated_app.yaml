        Thanks for making this bug report.
        
        - App version, means **our** version, that's the second part after `_`
        - When using an outdated version of SCLAE, your issue will, likely, be closed and locked without any comment
        - Apps in the *incubator* train, **CANNOT be reported as outdated**, as they might not even be functional at all
        - Apps in the *stable* train, can be reported after the container update is at least **1 month old**
        - Apps in the *Enterprise* and *dependency* trains, can be reported after the container update is **at least 7 days old**
